# site-inspector

Site inspector is a tool to automate navigating web pages and checking for
problems.

The initial target is finding broken links and anchors in
https://docs.sentry.io.

Other problems that can be surfaced:

- Missing images or any other resources (JS, CSS, etc)
- Links that redirect to another page (can be replaced for their canonical URL)
